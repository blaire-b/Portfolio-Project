            <div id="about"><p>Welcome! I'm Blaire, a web developer based in Florida. I made the switch into Tech from a finance background, and I am excited to be able to build beautiful projects for the web. </p>
            <p>I started my programming journey with online classes, later moving on to bootcamp curriculum, in order to become a professional web developer. </p>
            <p>What I love about development is the ability to work on various projects, problem solving, and creating something of value for someone. When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy soapmaking, baking, and being in nature.</p></div>
